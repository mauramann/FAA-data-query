Hi! My name is Maura Mann and I'm a first year graduate student at Georgetown University studying Data Science & Analytics. I've put together this website to serve as a landing page to view data visualizations of flight data from June 2019.

The data itself was collected from the United States Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

It can be found here: [Transportation Statistics](hhttps://www.transtats.bts.gov)
