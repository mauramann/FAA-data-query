    "text": "Part 2: Number of Flights\nNext, I wanted to explore the number of flights. I first made a time series graph, looking at the total number of flights over the course of the month.\nHover over the data points to see the fluctuations in the number of flights over the month!\nI observed a cylical pattern where the past three day average number of flights was lower on the weekends and higher during the week. This may reflect the fact that airlines cater more flights for business travel during the week for a non-holiday heavy month.\n\n\nCode\n# Make sure flight dates are date type\nflight_report$FlightDate &lt;- as.Date(flight_report$FlightDate)\n\n# Create time series interactive plot\nmy_time_series &lt;- flight_report |&gt; ggplot(aes(x=FlightDate, y=three_day_avg)) + \ngeom_point(size = 1) + \ngeom_area(alpha = 1/2, fill = 'lightblue') +\ntheme_minimal()+\nlabs(x = \"Date\", y = \"Average Number of Flights (Past Three Days)\", title = \"Average Number of Flights over the Past Three Days in June, 2019\") + \ntheme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5))\ninteractive_plot &lt;- ggplotly(my_time_series)\ninteractive_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondly, I looked at the overall break down of number of flights per week day. The weekend has a slightly larger number of total flights, however, the weekdays are all about even and not far off from the weekend values. This tells me that even though Saturday and Sunday have higher flight numbers, their past three day averages get lowered either by a lower week day value and/or week day values having consistently high values throughout the entire month.\n\n\nCode\n# Load color palettes\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n# Create pie chart\nmy_pie &lt;- plot_ly(rank_days, \nlabels = ~Day, \nvalues=~num_flights, \ntype=\"pie\")\n\nmy_pie |&gt; layout(title = list(text=\"Number of Flights by Day of Week\"))"

    "text": "Part 3: Airline Trends\nIn this next section, I wanted to dive deeper into airline trends. I specifically wanted to see if there was a relationship between an airline having the maximum delay and the maximum early departure.\nI did this by plotting the maximum early departure on the x-axis and the maximum delay on the y-axis. Each point represents an indiviudal airline that you can see by hoving over the data point.\n\n\nCode\n# Combine data sets together\ncombined_data &lt;- inner_join(max_delay, max_early, by = \"name\")\ncombined_data$Max_Early &lt;- abs(combined_data$Max_Early)\n\n# Create scatter plot\nmy_scatterplot &lt;- combined_data |&gt; ggplot(aes(x=Max_Early, y=Max_Delay, color = name)) +\ngeom_point(shape = 18) +\ntheme_minimal()+\nlabs(x = \"Maximum Early Departure (Min)\", y = \"Maximum Flight Delay (Min)\", color = \"Airline\", title = \"Airline Maximum Early Departure vs Delay\") + \ntheme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5), legend.position = \"none\")\ninteractive_scatter &lt;- ggplotly(my_scatterplot)\ninteractive_scatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn viewing the graph, I don’t see any correlation between the two variables. However, I wanted to verify this quickly by getting the pearson correlation coefficient.\n\nPearson Correlation Coefficient\n\n\nCode\ncor(combined_data$Max_Early, combined_data$Max_Delay)\n\n\n[1] 0.06169178\n\n\nThe pearson correlation coefficient value reveals there is virtually no correlation at all between maximum early departure and maximum delay. This could be potentially very important information for travelers when booking since we can’t confidently say that an airline with the lowest maximum delay also has the highest maximum early departure (and therefore shouldn’t be a deciding factor when choosing an airline)."

There are various reasons why a flight might be cancelled but they can generally be summed up in the following categories:\n\nWeather: conditions outside were not safe for flying.\nCarrier: the airline itself cancelled the flight (up to their discretion).\nNational Air System: the flight had to be cancelled due to a directive from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe below graph simply only summarizes the cancellation reasons that were the top reason at each airport.\n\n\nCode\n# Create summary table\ncancelled_summary &lt;- cancelled_reason |&gt;\ngroup_by(Reason) |&gt; summarise(total = sum(num_cancellations))\n\n# Create pie chart\nmy_piechart &lt;- plot_ly(cancelled_summary, \nlabels = ~Reason, \nvalues=~total, \ntype=\"pie\")\n\nmy_piechart |&gt; layout(title = list(text=\"Flight Cancellations by Reason\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Weather is more than 50% of the top reason flights are cancelled.

    "text": "Conclusion\nIt’s important for travelers to be informed when they’re booking their flights. In each section, I looked into a different aspect of the airline industry to extract information.\nWhen travelers are looking for flight options, they may want to know that there are overall more options on the weekend, but there may be more consistency during the week days. They should know that just because an airline hasn’t had a large delay compared to other airlines, it doesn’t necessarily mean they have the earliest take off times.\nAirports range in average delays. Travelers should be prepared to experience a delay based on potentially where they’re flying out from and even experience a cancellation if there’s bad weather.\nWhile this is just a glimpse, this project further shows that FAA data is very diverse and can be used to draw many conclusions about the U.S. air industry."
